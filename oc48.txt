SS between a customer and a product is this: 

1. If the number of letters in the product's name is even then the SS is the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u, y) in the customer's name multiplied by 1.5. 
2. If the number of letters in the product's name is odd then the SS is the number of consonants in the customer's name. 
3. If the number of letters in the product's name shares any common factors (besides 1) with the number of letters in the customer's name then the SS is multiplied by 1.5. 

Your task is to implement a program that assigns each customer a product to be offered in a way that maximizes the combined total SS across all of the chosen offers. Note that there may be a different number of products and customers. You may include code from external libraries as long as you cite the source.
